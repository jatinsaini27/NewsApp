# Android News Application

This Android News Application is developed using Android Studio. It allows users to view the latest news articles from various sources. This README file contains instructions on how to set up the project in Android Studio, run it on an emulator, and provides an explanation of the project structure and features.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project in Android Studio:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**: Launch Android Studio and open the project by selecting the root directory of the cloned repository.

3. **Wait for Gradle Sync**: Android Studio will automatically perform a Gradle sync to download dependencies and set up the project. Wait for this process to complete.

4. **Set Up API Key**: Obtain an API key for the news service you're using (e.g., News API, Guardian API) and replace the placeholder API key in the project with your own. This is usually done in the `Constants.java` file or similar.

5. **Run the Application**: Run the application on an emulator or physical device by clicking on the "Run" button in Android Studio's toolbar.
